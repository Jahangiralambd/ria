Bare bones and extremely light weight HTML5/JavaScript RIA Framework. Designed for maintainability, simplicity, and rapid development.

This framework implements a dynamic MV* structure for app development, and does not implement any UI or UX styles, it is only meant to make your 
development faster, more maintainable, and more **reuseable** via a modular approach.
